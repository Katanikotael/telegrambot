## Deployment
Deployment process as easy as possible:
Required software:
- terminal for running bash scripts
- docker
- docker-compose

to deploy application, switch to needed branch and run bash script:

<code>$ bash start.sh ${bot_username} ${bot_token}</code>

to stop application run stop.sh:

<code>$ bash stop.sh</code>

That's all.
